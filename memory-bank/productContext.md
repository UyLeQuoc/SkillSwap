# Product Context: SkillSwap

## Problem Statement
In HCMC, many people have valuable skills and resources they could share, but lack an efficient way to connect with others who need them. Similarly, people with specific needs often struggle to find the right help or resources within their community. Traditional platforms lack trust mechanisms and don't provide verifiable proof of skill exchanges.

## Solution
SkillSwap provides a Web3 platform where:
- Users connect via Sui wallet for decentralized identity
- Users can offer their skills (e.g., language teaching, technical help)
- Users can offer items for trade/barter
- Users can request specific help or items
- The platform matches complementary needs and offers
- Community members can connect and exchange value
- Successful exchanges are verified through NFT SkillBadges
