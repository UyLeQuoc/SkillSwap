## Current Status
- Planning phase for Post and Deal system implementation
- Analyzing existing codebase structure
- Preparing for NFT integration

## What Works
- Basic project structure
- GraphQL setup
- Prisma schema
- Existing deal system
- Sui integration foundation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Post System
1. Create Post Module
   - GraphQL resolvers
   - Service implementation
   - DTOs and entities
   - Input validation

2. Post Features
   - Create post
   - Update post
   - Delete post
   - List posts
   - Search posts

### Phase 2: Deal System
1. Deal Module Integration
   - Extend existing deal system
   - Add NFT minting triggers
   - Implement deal status updates

2. Deal Features
   - Request deal
   - Accept deal
   - Complete deal
   - Cancel deal
   - List deals

### Phase 3: NFT Integration
1. NFT Minting
   - Integrate with Sui SDK
   - Implement minting service
   - Handle transaction states
   - Store NFT metadata

2. NFT Display
   - Create frontend components
   - Implement NFT listing
   - Add NFT details view
   - Handle wallet connection

## What's Left to Build
1. Post Module
   - [ ] Module structure
   - [ ] GraphQL resolvers
   - [ ] Service implementation
   - [ ] DTOs and entities
   - [ ] Input validation

2. Deal System
   - [ ] Deal request flow
   - [ ] Deal acceptance flow
   - [ ] NFT minting integration
   - [ ] Deal status management

3. NFT Features
   - [ ] Minting service
   - [ ] Transaction handling
   - [ ] Frontend components
   - [ ] Wallet integration

## Known Issues
- Need to define validation rules for Post skills
- Need to determine NFT minting transaction handling
- Need to establish frontend component requirements
- Need to plan GraphQL schema extensions

## Next Steps
1. Create Post module structure
2. Implement basic Post CRUD operations
3. Integrate with existing deal system
4. Add NFT minting functionality
5. Build frontend components
6. Test and deploy features

## Recent Updates
- Created implementation plan
- Analyzed existing codebase
- Identified integration points
- Documented requirements
